# (E) Tuple in Python: Check Element Existence

## ðŸŽ¯ Aim:
To write a Python program that checks if the element `'n'` and the element `8` exist within a given tuple.

## ðŸ§  Algorithm:
1. Define a tuple `x` with some letters and numbers.
2. Use the `in` operator to check if the string `'n'` exists within the tuple.
3. Use the `in` operator to check if the integer `8` exists within the tuple.
4. Print the results.

## ðŸ§¾ Program:

    tup = eval(input("Enter a tuple of elements with characters and numbers:"))
    if 'n' in tup and 8 in tup :
        print ("The character 'n' and the number (8) are exists in the given tuple")
    elif 'n' in tup and 8 not in tup :
        print ("The character 'n' exists in the given tuple but the number (8) doesn't exist")
    elif 'n' not in tup and 8 in tup :
        print ("The number (8) exists in the given tuple but the character 'n' doesn't exist")
    else:
         print("Both 'n' and 8 are not exist in the givn tuple")

## Result:

Thus, The Python program that checks if the element `'n'` and the element `8` exist within a given tuple was executed successfully.
